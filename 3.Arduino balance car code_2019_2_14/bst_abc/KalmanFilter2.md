## Filtering Noisy Data: From Motion Models to Approximation Theory 
üìà The [Wikipedia example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter#Example_application,_technical) of the Kalman filter derives the state-space equations using physics-based motion formulas for a truck's position and velocity:

$$x(t+dt) = x(t) + v(t)dt + a\frac{dt^2}{2}$$

But what if your data isn't about motion at all?

In many real-world filtering tasks ‚Äî especially when dealing with noisy signals from arbitrary sensors ‚Äî the measurements may be completely unrelated to physical motion. So instead of relying on a motion model, I prefer an approach based on Approximation Theory.

Assume your signal is smooth ‚Äî that is, it has at least a first and second derivative ‚Äî and is simply corrupted by noise. Under this assumption, we can apply a Taylor series expansion:

$$x(t+dt) = x(t) + x'(t)dt + x''\frac{dt^2}{2} + O(dt^3)$$

üëâ As you can see, the structure of the Taylor expansion matches the motion equation exactly ‚Äî without requiring any physical model.

üîç For beginners, this perspective can be powerful: even if your data isn‚Äôt related to position or velocity, you can still derive Kalman-style state equations just by assuming the signal is smooth.

This reframing makes filtering accessible across domains ‚Äî from IoT sensor data to biomedical signals to financial trends.

## The Discrete Linear Kalman Filter

The **state vector** is:

$$x_k=\\begin{bmatrix}
\theta \\ 
\omega
\end{bmatrix}\_{t+dt}$$

**The system model** (how the state evolves over time) is:

$$\begin{bmatrix}
\theta \\ 
\omega
\end{bmatrix}\_{t+dt}=\begin{pmatrix}1 & dt \\
0 & 1\end{pmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
\theta \\ 
\omega
\end{bmatrix}\_{t}+\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1}{2}{dt}^2 \\ 
dt
\end{bmatrix}{\alpha}(t)
$$

or

$$
\begin{cases}
\theta(t+dt) = \theta(t) + \omega(t) \cdot dt + \alpha(t) \cdot \frac{{dt}^2}{2}\\
\omega(t+dt) = \omega(t) + \alpha(t) \cdot dt
\end{cases}
$$

where

- $$\theta(t)$$ is the angle.
- $$\omega(t) = {\theta}'$$ is the anglular velosity
- $$\alpha(t) = {\theta}''$$ is the acceleration

so that 

$$x_k=F\x_{k-1}+w_k$$

$$Q=\begin{pmatrix}Q_{angle} & 0 \\
0 & Q_{gyro}\end{pmatrix}$$

Measurement equation: $$z=Cx+v$$ , where $$C$$ is the measurement matrix
